				1 => 'In order to found a new village you need 3 settlers, an empty spot on the map and enough culture points. 
						You do not have to research settlers as you can directly build them with a palace level 10, 15 or 20 or a residence level 10 or 20. 
						To build the palace you need a main building level 5 and an embassy. 
						To build the residence you only need a level 5 main building. 
						After training the 3 settlers you can choose an empty spot on the map and click "Found new village" 
						(Hint: you need 750 units of each resource!) then your settlers will leave their home village and found the new village for you.',
				2 => 'For this, too, one needs at least a residence/palace level 10 as well as an enemy village one can conquer. 
						Additionally enough culture points are needed - like for founding a new village. 
						One cannot conquer the last of a player\'s villages and neither their capital.
   					:br :br
   					As soon as the steward of a town (senator, chief, chieftain) as been researched in the academy one can train him in the residence/palace like a settler. 
						However, one may not have already trained settlers in order to be able to train a steward. 
						To conquer a village the steward needs to attack the desired village a couple of times after the enemy residence/palace has been demolished. 
						Once the village\'s loyalty reached zero the village will become one\'s own. Once this happened one should build a palace or a residence to raise the loyalty again.',
				3 => 'One gets culture points (CPs) by constructing and extending buildings.
						Already produced culture points can be seen in the residence and palace. 
						Additionally information about the required culture points for additional villages is displayed there.'
